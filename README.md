# Image-to-Caption-Generator

In this project, we developed an Image Caption Generator using deep learning techniques. The aim was to build a model that can generate meaningful textual descriptions for given input images. This project involved collecting a dataset of images and their corresponding captions, training a deep learning model, and integrating it into a web application.

To start, we gathered a dataset of images and their associated captions. Once we have completed the data collection process, we proceeded to build the Image Caption Generator model.
For the deep learning aspect, we utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in combination. CNNs were used to extract meaningful features from the input images, while RNNs, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were employed to generate captions based on the extracted features.
